Create a simple stack. The question said the stack could be integers, floats, etc, but I will just use integers here.

All operations below must operate in constant time.

should be able to do the following operations:
* push a value onto the stack
* pop a value from the stack, returning it.

should be able to get the following attributes:
* min value in stack
* max value in the stack
* average value of anything on the stack

There's 2 versions under the pkg dir.
